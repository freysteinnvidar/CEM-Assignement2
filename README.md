# CEM-Assignement2
# Two Assignement- The Capacitor and The Gaussian Pulse
# There Are Two Files With The Capacitance Computation
# capac_matrix & capac_matrix_2
# They Are Identical Except In capac_matrix_2 We Modify The Grid And The Size Of The Capacitor So That The Grids Land On Both Conductors
# This Only Works For Square Conductors
